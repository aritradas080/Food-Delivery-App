# Project Name: Online Food Delivery App Backend

## Description:
This is the backend part of an online food delivery service built using C#, .NET, and MySQL REST API. The project provides functionalities for four types of users: customers, restaurants, admins, and delivery personnel. The flow of the website allows customers to register and log in, view registered restaurants, select a restaurant, add food items to the cart, and provide their location for delivery. A delivery person is then assigned, and the delivery status is updated accordingly. The admin has access to all features and can also perform business analytics.

Key Features:
- User Management: Allows customers, restaurants, admins, and delivery personnel to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- Restaurant Listings: Displays a list of registered restaurants for customers to choose from.
- Cart Management: Enables customers to add food items to their cart before placing an order.
- Delivery Management: Assigns a delivery person to the order and updates the delivery status.
- Admin Access: Provides admin users with full access to all features and business analytics.

Technologies Used:
- C#: Programming language used for the backend development.
- .NET: Framework used for building web applications with C#.
- MySQL: Database management system used for storing and retrieving data.
- REST API: Enables communication between the frontend and backend through HTTP requests.
